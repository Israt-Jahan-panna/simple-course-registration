#How can I Manage the state in this assignment project. 
State management is a crucial aspect of React development to maintain and update the data that a component displays. 

#I have use this for my project data update in state.
# here is some part :
allCourse: This state variable holds the data for all available courses fetched from a JSON file. It is initialized as an empty array and populated with course data using the useState hook.

selectedCourse: This state variable keeps track of the courses that the user has selected. It starts as an empty array and is updated as users select courses.

remaining: This state variable tracks the remaining credit hours that a user can select. It is initialized to 0 and updated whenever a course is selected or deselected.

totalCredits: This state variable stores the total number of credit hours of the selected courses. It is also initialized to 0 and updated as courses are selected or deselected.

totalPrice: This state variable stores the total price of the selected courses. Like the others, it is initialized to 0 and updated accordingly. 

In this project i  manages state within the component to facilitate the course selection process, provide real-time feedback, and ensure that users stay within specified credit limits. .
